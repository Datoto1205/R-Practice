## Introduction

In order to learn the knowledge about R and Tableau, I produced several files in this project. First of all, I tried to learn how to write R codes. I put the codes I wrote during the process of practice in the file of 'Fundamental setting and control flow' and ‘Medium Practice’. Moreover, I also tried to use some third-party package in the file ‘Stock Price’ and ‘Quantitative method & Decision tree’ in order to do something fascinating, such as prediction of stock price and classification. Additionally, after I obtained some fundamental knowledge about R, I tried to answer the questions of prediction found on Kaggle. I selected a question to answer, and I put the codes of my answer in the file 'Kaggle Question Practice- Titanic'. I even tried to use .rmd file, which was named ‘Report of Kaggle Question Practice- Titanic’ in my project, to illustrate the outcome of my answer.

By the way, I even create diagrams shown in the file ‘Report of Kaggle Question Practice- Titanic’ with Tableau, another Business Intelligence (BI) software. Due to the version of the software I used, I could not upload my file onto Github directly. The link of this file was shown below:
